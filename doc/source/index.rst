DataClean
=========

Welcome to the documentation of the DataClean Python API. 
DataClean offers automated, data-driven support to help users clean data 
effectively and smoothly. Given a random raw dataset representing a machine 
learning problem, the Python tool is capable of automatically identifying 
the potential issues and reporting the results and recommendations to the 
end-user in an effective way. DataClean is designed with a strong connection 
to `OpenML <https://www.openml.org/>`_ which is a platform where people can 
easily share data, experiments and machine learning models. Users can easily 
inspect and clean the datasets from OpenML with the dataset ID with DataClean.
